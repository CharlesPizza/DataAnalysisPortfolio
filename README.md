# Data Analysis - Charles Pizza
<p>Here I showcase a few projects that I have worked on in the field of Data Analysis. Some projects also contain Machine Learning, more of which you can find in the repositories of this github. Python is my preferred language for Data Analysis, however I have also utilized SQL, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Java, C++, Tableau, MicrosoftBI and others in order to cohesively advertise the garnered data. </p>

## Projects
<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/BoxOfficeMovies'><strong>Web Scraper</strong></a>
  <p>In this project I utilized several webscrapping libraries inorder to build an application to aggregate data across several affiliated websites which have a secure API and flex script. <br>
  Libraries: bs4, selenium, re, requests, pandas, numpy, lxml</p>
</div>

<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/HealthRiskAssessment'><strong>Prediction of Hypertension, Stroke and,  Diabetes</strong></a>
  <p>Multilabel machine learning assessment. Currently in phase of isolating different well performing models and weighting classes<br>
    Libraries: sklearn, scipy, pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib
  </p>

<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/FlaskRanking'><strong>Movie Queue Rest API</strong></a>
  <p>In this project I created a FLASK REST API so our discord group can login, add movies to a queue and vote on them so we can see which movie everyone is interested in. Features include an SQLite3 database of horror movies, flex layout, grid layout, search dropdown table selection, ordered view of movies in queue, HTMX for minimal code interactions.<br>
  Libraries: Flask, sqlite3, werkzeug, HTML, CSS, HTMX</p>

<div>
  <a href='https://www.github.com/CharlesPizza/'><strong>Movie Recommendation System</strong></a>
  <p>Here we create a recommendation system using a CSR Matrix and a KNNeighbors (Euclidean Distance) Algorthym. The recommendations are item based and segregated by genres. We've created only a small filesystem of images, so the interface reflects only this subsection, however it is ready to be easily converted to the entire movie library as all functions are the same. <br>
  Libraries: pyarrow, numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, </p>
</div>

<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/AudioAnalysisDollyParton'><strong>Audio Analysis of Dolly Parton Interview</strong></a>
  <p>Here we use AssemblyAI to perform audio analysis on small interview segments. We make a few notes on the sentiment analysis and frequency of words used. While the interviews are to small or short to form anything concrete, we are able to draw out a few simple patterns of speech and personal focus.<br>
  Libraries: pandas, hvplot, matplotlib, numpy, AssemblyAI</p>
</div>

<div>
  <a href='https://github.com/CharlesPizza/HeartFailure'><strong>Heart Failure Prediction</strong></a>
  <p>Here we do random forest modeling to predict death events following hospital admissions. Using exploritory data analysis we attempt to identify relevant features and disprove them. We do this with and without time components due to the problems inherit with time analysis and monitoring periods. <br>
    Libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib
